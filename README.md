#  Mobile Data Literacy Analysis

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project analyzes mobile data usage patterns and digital literacy levels using a dataset tailored for training program development. The goal is to extract insights that can inform decisions on how to improve digital inclusion and mobile technology training across various communities.

##  Files
- `Mobile Data usage.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing all the data analysis steps.

## 🧪 Features Explored
The analysis covers:
- Demographic breakdown of mobile users
- Data usage statistics (amount, frequency)
- Literacy levels and device access
- Digital engagement behavior (e.g., app usage, internet access)
- Outlier detection and data quality checks

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation  
  - `numpy` for numerical operations  
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` for data visualization  
  - `statistics` for basic statistical functions  

## 📊 Analysis Steps
1. **Data Loading**: Reads `.csv` file into a DataFrame.
2. **Preprocessing**: Checks shape, nulls, and basic summaries.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes key variables and detects trends or anomalies.
4. **Insights Generation**: Identifies patterns and actionable findings relevant to mobile literacy training.

## 🧠 Key Insights (Example)
- Younger users tend to consume more mobile data than older demographics.
- A strong correlation exists between device ownership and digital skill level.
- Urban users show higher levels of digital literacy but also greater variation in usage patterns.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the notebook.
2. Make sure you have Python installed (3.7+).
3. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
📈 Future Enhancements
Integrate prediction models (e.g., clustering, regression)

Deploy a dashboard with real-time visualizations

Expand dataset with survey results or mobile network logs
